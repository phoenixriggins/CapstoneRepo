<p>Hi, my name is Phoenix. I'm a recent highschool graduate and I love to learn! For a long-time,
I had no clue what I was going to do after I graduated. It wasn’t that I had no interest,
it was that I had too many and they were growing. I was scared of going to college
and getting so caught up in grades that I wouldn’t learn anything. My big brother,
Savion, did the cohort twice and highly recommended it to me.
After the preview and long deepdive with Savion, I found that coding has many different aspects for me to learn.</p>
