        Throughout most of my highschool career, I struggled with staying
        organized with my work. So for my capstone project, I made an assignment
        tracking website. While in school, most tracking apps I used were
        time-consuming to use. I wanted to create something that you could pull
        out when your teachers starts a sentence and have in your calendar by
        the time theyâ€™re done. I wanted for my website to be easy and quick to
        use so I made sure the user could enter multiple assignments at once. I
        used javascript, html5, css, etc.
