        Hi, my name is Phoenix. I'm a recent highschool graduate and I love to
        learn! For a long-time, I had no clue what I was going to do after I
        graduated. It wasn’t that I had no interest, it was that I had too many
        and they were growing. I was scared of going to college and getting so
        caught up in grades that I wouldn’t learn anything. My big brother,
        Savion, did the cohort twice and highly recommended it to me. After the
        preview and long deepdive with Savion, I found that coding has many
        different aspects for me to learn.
